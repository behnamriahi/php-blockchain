PHP Blockchain is a simple implementation of the blockchain data structure and proof-of-work using the PHP programming language. It is designed as an introduction to blockchain technology for PHP programmers.

To run, download the source code, and, from the command line, run:

```sh
$ php example/simplechain.php
```

This will output a simple blockchain with 3 blocks.

```sh
$ php example/hackchain.php
```

This will validate the chain before and after a block is changed and shows the immutability of blockchains.
